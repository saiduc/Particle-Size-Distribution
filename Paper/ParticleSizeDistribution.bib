abstract = {We discuss different ways to convert observed, apparent particle size distributions from 2D sections (thin sections, SEM maps on planar surfaces, etc.) into true 3D particle size distributions. We give a simple, flexible and practical method to do this, show which of these techniques gives the most faithful conversions, and provide (online) short computer codes to calculate both 2D-3D recoveries and simulations of 2D observations by random sectioning. The most important systematic bias of 2D sectioning, from the standpoint of most chondrite studies, is an overestimate of the abundance of the larger particles. We show that fairly good recoveries can be achieved from observed size distributions containing 100-300 individual measurements of apparent particle diameter.},

abstract = {Packing problems arise in a wide variety of practical applications. The basic problem is that of placing as many objects as possible in a non-overlapping configuration within a given container. Problems involving irregular shapes are the most challenging cases. In this paper, we consider the most general forms of irregular shape packing problems in 3D space, where both the containers and the objects can be of any shapes, and free rotations of the objects are allowed. We propose a heuristic method for efficiently packing irregular objects by combining continuous optimization and combinatorial optimization. Starting from an initial placement of an appropriate number of objects, we optimize the positions and orientations of the objects using continuous optimization. In combinatorial optimization, we further reduce the gaps between objects by swapping and replacing the deployed objects and inserting new objects. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method with experiments and comparisons.},

abstract = {It is very important to determine the proper or accurate sample size in any field of research. Sometimes researchers cannot take the decision that how many numbers of individuals or objects will they select for their study purpose. Also, a set of survey data is used to verify that central limit theorem (CLT) for different sample sizes. From the data of 1348 students, we got the average weight for our population of BRAC University students is 62.62 kg with standard deviation 11.79 kg. We observed that our sample means became better estimators of the true population mean. In addition, the shape of the distribution became more Normal as the sample size increased. So it is concluded that our simulation results were consistent with the central limit theorem.},

@techreport{Lekakh,
abstract = {Modern automated SEM/EDX analysis provides morphological and chemistry statistics for precise determination of phases, porosity and non-metallic inclusions using two-dimensional observations (polished random sections). However, the knowledge of the real three-dimensional distribution of these features in the microstructure is necessary for metallurgical process analysis and product property predictions. A special algorithm for the conversion of two-dimensional round particle distribution obtained from an automated SEM/EDX or optical imaging to the real three-dimensional spherical particle distribution was developed based on inverse modeling. A program generates a virtual two-dimensional distribution from 9-12 sets of normal distributions of spherical particles covering all size ranges using arbitrary slicing. These sets are optimized by comparison with particle sections observed in experiments. The applied inverse algorithm uses the built-in optimizer and error function in EXCEL. The method was applied for three-dimensional analysis of near spherical phases and inclusions in different iron alloys. In ductile iron with spherical graphite, the method revealed that spheroids could be mono or poly-dimensional depending on solidification kinetics. In high-alloyed Al-Mn steel, different dimensional classes of nitrides, sulfides and oxides were observed and related to the free energy of formation.},

abstract = {Size distribution of rigidly embedded spheres in a groundmass is usually determined from measurements of the radii of the two-dimensional (2D) circular cross sections of the spheres in random flat planes of a sample, such as in thin sections or polished slabs. Several methods have been devised to find a simple factor to convert the mean of such 2D size distributions to the actual 3D mean size of the spheres without a consensus. We derive an entirely theoretical solution based on well-established probability laws and not constrained by limitations of absolute size, which indicates that the ratio of the means of measured 2D and estimated 3D grain size distribution should be r/4 (=.785). Actual 2D size distribution of the radii of submicron sized, pure Fe0 globules in lunar agglutinitic glass, determined from backscattered electron images, is tested to fit the gamma size distribution model better than the log-normal model. Numerical analysis of 2D size distributions of Fe0 globules in 9 lunar soils shows that the average mean of 2D/3D ratio is 0.84, which is very close to the theoretical value. These results converge with the ratio 0.8 that Hughes (1978) determined for millimeter-sized chondrules from empirical measurements. We recommend that a factor of 1.273 (reciprocal of 0.785) be used to convert the determined 2D mean size (radius or diameter) of a population of spheres to estimate their actual 3D size. {\textcopyright} 2005 Geological Society of America.},
