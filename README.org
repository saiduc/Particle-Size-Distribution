#+TITLE: Investigating Particle Size Distributions (Wicksell's Corpuscle Problem)

This repository hosts my project for the PHYS6017 Computer Techniques in Physics
module, which I completed as part of my MPhys Astrophysics degree. The project
entailed randomly distributing spheres in space, allowing a plane to cut through
them, and analysing the cross-sections of the spheres on the plane. 

This project was completed using Python 3.
